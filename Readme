Express and RabbitMQ Integration Documentation

##Project Setup
Initialize and Configure the Express Project
Initialize the Project: Start by creating a new Node.js project using a package manager like npm. This involves creating a package.json file and installing necessary dependencies such as Express, RabbitMQ client libraries, and TypeScript.

Set Up TypeScript: Configure TypeScript for the project by creating a tsconfig.json file. This file will include the following:

{

"compilerOptions": { 
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "commonjs", 
    "outDir": "./dist", 
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true, 
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true, 
    "skipLibCheck": true 
 },
    "include": ["src/**/*"] 
} 


Directory Structure: Establish a directory structure for your project. Typically, you will have a src directory for source code and a dist directory for compiled JavaScript files.

Environment Configuration
Environment Variables: Create a .env file to store configuration details such as RabbitMQ connection settings and server port. Use a library like dotenv to load these environment variables into your application.

##RabbitMQ Configuration

Connecting to RabbitMQ
Setup RabbitMQ Connection: Establish a connection to RabbitMQ using connection settings provided in your .env file. Configure the connection to handle authentication and specify the queue to interact with.

Channel Management: Create a communication channel with RabbitMQ, which will be used to send and receive messages. Ensure the queue is declared and set up correctly.

##SMS Sending Logic

SMS Sending Simulation
SMS Simulation: Implement a function to simulate SMS sending. This function will be responsible for "sending" SMS messages by logging them to the console with a delay to mimic real-world SMS sending.

##Setup
Message Consumption: Configure the application to consume messages from the RabbitMQ queue. Implement message handling to process incoming messages by parsing them and invoking the SMS sending function.
Error Handling: Ensure proper error handling and acknowledgment of messages. Implement logic to acknowledge successfully processed messages and reject or requeue messages that encounter errors.

Running the Project
Compile the Project: Compile TypeScript source files into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler.
Start the Application: Run the compiled application to start the Express server and begin processing messages from RabbitMQ.
